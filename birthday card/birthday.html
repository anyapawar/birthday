                    Every one of your birthdays<br>
                    is a gift to the rest of us<br>
                    who have had the pleasure<br>
                    of having you in our lives<br>
                    for another year.<br>
                    Every one of your birthdays<br>
                    brings joyful memories<br>
                    of your bright smile<br>
                    and your love of life.<br>
                    Every one of your birthdays<br>
                    reminds us of your sensitivity<br>
                    and service to others,<br>
                    and other delights<br>
                    too numerous to name<br>
                    that we are gifted with<br>
                    just by knowing you.<br>
                    Happy Birthday<br>
